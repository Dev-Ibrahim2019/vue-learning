#### Assignments system (like to-do project)  

- **Overview**
  + The assignments distributed in two parts:
    * In progress tasks.
    * Completed tasks.
  

#### How the system is going on:
- The system will fetch the data from the database.json that you can run it through json-server.
- Make the system flixible by create componets and using slots.
- The way of create component makes the code flexible and reusable. 
> Should understand that any specific component is responsible for what ?!!
- Add listner for events from parent component to child and vise versa.
- Finally, create cards and make the app flixible for adds-on it. "you can also change themes and exit card"

#### To Start diving into project:
Run the following into the root of your code in the terminal ...
```
npm run start
npm run json-server
```
Hopefully it works for you!<br />
Happy code! :man_technologist::fire:
